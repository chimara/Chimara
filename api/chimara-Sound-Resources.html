<p>
As with graphics, so with sound. Sounds, however, obviously don't appear in windows. To play a sound in Glk, you must first create a sound channel to hold it. This is an entirely new class of opaque objects; there are <code class="code">create</code> and <code class="code">destroy</code> and <code class="code">iterate</code> and <code class="code">get_rock</code> functions for channels, just as there are for windows and streams and filerefs.
</p>
<p>
A channel can be playing exactly one sound at a time. If you want to play more than one sound simultaneously, you need more than one sound channel. On the other hand, a single sound can be played on several channels at the same time, or overlapping itself.
</p>
<p>
Sound is an optional capability in Glk.
</p>
<p>
As with images, sounds are kept in resources, and your program does not have to worry about the formatting or storage. A resource is referred to by an integer identifier.
</p>
<p>
A resource can theoretically contain any kind of sound data, of any length. A resource can even be infinitely long.

<p>This would be represented by some sound encoding with a built-in repeat-forever flag — but that is among the details which are hidden from you.
</p>
</div>
<p>
A resource can also contain two or more channels of sound (stereo data). Do not confuse such in-sound channels with Glk sound channels. A single Glk sound channel suffices to play any sound, even stereo sounds.
</p>

<p>
Again, Blorb is the official resource-storage format of Glk. Sounds in Blorb files can be encoded as Ogg, AIFF, or MOD. See the Blorb specification for details.
