<title>Description</title>
<para>
These values, and the values used for future Glk calls, are integers in the range <code>0x0001</code> to <code>0xFFFF</code> (1 to 65535). The values are not sequential; they are divided into groups, roughly by category. Zero is not the selector of any
Glk call, so it may be used for a null value.
</para>
&selectors;
<para>
Note that <function>glk_main()</function> does not have a selector, because it's provided by your program, not the library.
</para>
<para>
There is no way to use these selectors directly in the Glk API.
<note><para>
An earlier version of Glk had gestalt selectors <code>gestalt_FunctionNameToID</code> and <code>gestalt_FunctionIDToName</code>, but these have been withdrawn.
</para></note>
They are defined and used only by the dispatch layer.
</para>
<para>
Call selectors 0x1200 to 0x12FF are reserved for extension projects by Carlos Sanchez.
The same is true of gestalt selector 0x1200.
These are not documented here.
