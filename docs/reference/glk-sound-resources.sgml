As with graphics, so with sound. Sounds, however, obviously don't appear in windows. To play a sound in Glk, you must first create a sound channel to hold it. This is an entirely new class of opaque objects; there are <code>create</code> and <code>destroy</code> and <code>iterate</code> and <code>get_rock</code> functions for channels, just as there are for windows and streams and filerefs.
</para><para>
A channel can be playing exactly one sound at a time. If you want to play more than one sound simultaneously, you need more than one sound channel. On the other hand, a single sound can be played on several channels at the same time, or overlapping itself.

Sound is an optional capability in Glk.

As with images, sounds are kept in resources, and your program does not have to worry about the formatting or storage. A resource is referred to by an integer identifier.
</para><para>
A resource can theoretically contain any kind of sound data, of any length. A resource can even be infinitely long.
<note><para>This would be represented by some sound encoding with a built-in repeat-forever flag &mdash; but that is among the details which are hidden from you.
</para></note>
A resource can also contain two or more channels of sound (stereo data). Do not confuse such in-sound channels with Glk sound channels. A single Glk sound channel suffices to play any sound, even stereo sounds.

Again, Blorb is the official resource-storage format of Glk. Sounds in Blorb files can be encoded as Ogg, AIFF, or MOD. See the Blorb specification for details.
