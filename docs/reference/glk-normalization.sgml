<title>Description</title>
<para>
With all of these Unicode transformations hovering about, an author might reasonably ask about the right way to handle line input.
Our recommendation is: call glk_buffer_to_lower_case_uni(), followed by glk_buffer_canon_normalize_uni(), and then parse the result.
The parsing process should of course match against strings that have been put through the same process.
</para>
<para>
The Unicode spec (chapter 3.13) gives a different, three-step process: decomposition, case-folding, and decomposition again.
Our recommendation comes through a series of practical compromises:
</para>
<itemizedlist>
  <listitem><para>
    The initial decomposition is only necessary because of a historical error in the Unicode spec: character 0x0345 (COMBINING GREEK YPOGEGRAMMENI) behaves inconsistently.
	We ignore this case, and skip this step.
  </para></listitem>
  <listitem><para>
    Case-folding is a slightly different operation from lower-casing.
	(Case-folding splits some combined characters, so that, for example, “&szlig;” can match both “ss” and “SS”.)
	However, Glk does not currently offer a case-folding function.
	We substitute glk_buffer_to_lower_case_uni().
  </para></listitem>
  <listitem><para>
    I'm not sure why the spec recommends decomposition (glk_buffer_canon_decompose_uni()) rather than glk_buffer_canon_normalize_uni().
	However, composed characters are the norm in source code, and therefore in compiled Inform game files.
	If we specified decomposition, the compiler would have to do extra work; also, the standard Inform dictionary table (with its fixed word length) would store fewer useful characters.
	Therefore, we substitute glk_buffer_canon_normalize_uni().

  We may revisit these recommendations in future versions of the spec.
