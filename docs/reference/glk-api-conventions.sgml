<title>Description</title>
<para>
The <filename class="headerfile">glk.h</filename> header file is the same on all platforms, with the sole exception of the typedef of #glui32 and #glsi32.
These will always be defined as 32-bit unsigned and signed integer types, which may be “<type>long</type>” or “<type>int</type>” or some other C definition.
</para>
<para>
Note that all constants are &num;defines. All functions are currently actual function declarations (as opposed to macros), but this may change in future Glk revisions. As in the standard C library, if Glk function is defined by a macro, an actual function of the same name will also be available.
</para>
<para>
Functions that return or generate boolean values will produce only 0 (%FALSE) or 1 (%TRUE). Functions that accept boolean arguments will accept any value, with zero indicating %FALSE and nonzero indicating %TRUE.
</para>
<para>
%NULL (when used in this document) refers to the C null pointer. As stated above, it is illegal to pass %NULL to a function which is expecting a valid object reference, unless the function definition says otherwise.
</para>
<para>
Some functions have pointer arguments, acting as “variable” or “reference” arguments; the function's intent is to return some value in the space pointed to by the argument.
Unless the function says otherwise, it is legal to pass %NULL to indicate that you do not care about that value.
