<title>Description</title>
<para>
The <filename class="headerfile">glk.h</filename> header file is the same on all platforms, with the sole exception of the typedef of #glui32 and #glsi32. These will always be defined as 32-bit unsigned and signed integer types, which may be <quote><type>long</type></quote> or <quote><type>int</type></quote> or some other C definition.
</para>
<para>
Note that all constants are &num;defines, and all functions are actual function declarations (as opposed to macros.)
</para>
<note><para>
There are a few places where macros would be more efficient &mdash; glk_gestalt() and glk_gestalt_ext(), for example &mdash; but they are not likely to be CPU bottlenecks, and clarity seems more important.
</para></note>
<para>
%FALSE is 0; %TRUE is 1. %NULL is also 0.
</para>
<para>
As stated above, it is illegal to pass %NULL to a function which is expecting a valid object reference, unless the function definition says otherwise.
</para>
<para>
Some functions have pointer arguments, acting as <quote>variable</quote> or <quote>reference</quote> arguments; the function's intent is to return some value in the space pointed to by the argument. Unless the function says otherwise, it is legal to pass a %NULL pointer to indicate that you do not care about that value.
