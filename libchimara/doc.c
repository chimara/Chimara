 * </para></note>
 * 
 * When you create one of these objects, it is always possible that the creation
 * will fail (due to lack of memory, or some other OS error.) When this happens,
 * the allocation function will return %NULL instead of a valid pointer. You
 * should always test for this possibility.
 * 
 * %NULL is never the identifier of any object (window, stream, file reference,
 * or sound channel). The value %NULL is often used to indicate <quote>no
 * object</quote> or <quote>nothing</quote>, but it is not a valid reference. If
 * a Glk function takes an object reference as an argument, it is illegal to
 * pass in %NULL unless the function definition says otherwise.
 * 
 * The <filename class="headerfile">glk.h</filename> file defines types
 * #winid_t, #strid_t, #frefid_t, #schanid_t to store references. These are
 * pointers to struct #glk_window_struct, #glk_stream_struct, 
 * #glk_fileref_struct, and #glk_schannel_struct respectively. It is, of course,
 * illegal to pass one kind of pointer to a function which expects another.
 * 
 * <note><para>
 * This is how you deal with opaque objects from a C program. If you are using

 * Calling <code>glk_<replaceable>CLASS</replaceable>_iterate(%NULL, r)</code>

 * </para>
 * <para>
 * The @rockptr argument is a pointer to a location; whenever  
 * <code>glk_<replaceable>CLASS</replaceable>_iterate()</code> returns an
 * object, the object's rock is stored in the location <code>(*@rockptr)</code>.
 * If you don't want the rocks to be returned, you may set @rockptr to %NULL.

/**
 * SECTION:glk-character-input
 * @short_description: Waiting for a single keystroke
 *
 * You can request that the player hit a single key. See <link 
 * linkend="chimara-Character-Input-Events">Character Input Events</link>.
 * 
 * If you use the basic text API, the character code which is returned can be
 * any value from 0 to 255. The printable character codes have already been
 * described. The remaining codes are typically control codes: <keycombo  
 * action="simul"><keycap function="control">control</keycap>
 * <keycap>A</keycap></keycombo> to <keycombo action="simul"><keycap 
 * function="control">control</keycap><keycap>Z</keycap></keycombo> and a few
 * others.
 * 
 * There are also a number of special codes, representing special keyboard
 * keys, which can be returned from a char-input event. These are represented
 * as 32-bit integers, starting with 4294967295 (0xFFFFFFFF) and working down.
 * The special key codes are defined in the <filename 
 * class="headerfile">glk.h</filename> file. They include one code for <keycap
 * function="enter">return</keycap> or <keycap function="enter">enter</keycap>,
 * one for <keycap function="delete">delete</keycap> or <keycap
 * function="backspace">backspace</keycap>, twelve function keys, and one code
 * for any key which has no Latin-1 or special code. The full list of key codes
 * is included below.
 * 
 * Various implementations of Glk will vary widely in which characters the
 * player can enter. The most obvious limitation is that some characters are
 * mapped to others. For example, most keyboards return a <keycombo
 * action="simul"><keycap function="control">control</keycap><keycap>I</keycap>
 * </keycombo> code when the <keycap function="tab">tab</keycap> key is
 * pressed. The Glk library, if it can recognize this at all, will generate a
 * <keysym>%keycode_Tab</keysym> event (value 0xFFFFFFF7) when this occurs.
 * Therefore, for these keyboards, no keyboard key will generate a <keycombo
 * action="simul"><keycap function="control">control</keycap><keycap>I</keycap>
 * </keycombo> event (value 9.) The Glk library will probably map many of the
 * control codes to the other special keycodes.
 * 
 * <note><para>
 *   On the other hand, the library may be very clever and discriminate between
 *   <keycap>tab</keycap> and <keycombo action="simul"><keycap
 *   function="control">control</keycap><keycap>I</keycap></keycombo>. This is
 *   legal. The idea is, however, that if your program asks the player to
 *   <quote><computeroutput>press the <keycap function="tab">tab</keycap>
 *   key</computeroutput></quote>, you should check for a 
 *   <keysym>%keycode_Tab</keysym> event as opposed to a <keycombo 
 *   action="simul"><keycap function="control">control</keycap>
 *   <keycap>I</keycap></keycombo> event.
 * </para></note>
 * 
 * Some characters may not be enterable simply because they do not exist.
 * 
 * <note><para>
 *   Not all keyboards have a <keycap function="home">home</keycap> or <keycap
 *   function="end">end</keycap> key. A pen-based platform may not recognize
 *   any control characters at all.
 * </para></note>
 * 
 * Some characters may not be enterable because they are reserved for the
 * purposes of the interface. For example, the Mac Glk library reserves the 
 * <keycap function="tab">tab</keycap> key for switching between different Glk
 * windows. Therefore, on the Mac, the library will never generate a
 * <keysym>%keycode_Tab</keysym> event or a <keycombo action="simul">
 * <keycap function="control">control</keycap><keycap>I</keycap></keycombo>
 * event.
 * 
 * <note><para>
 *   Note that the linefeed or <keycombo action="simul"><keycap  
 *   function="control">control</keycap><keycap>J</keycap></keycombo> 
 *   character, which is the only printable control character, is probably not
 *   typable. This is because, in most libraries, it will be converted to
 *   <keysym>%keycode_Return</keysym>. Again, you should check for
 *   <keysym>%keycode_Return</keysym> if your program asks the player to 
 *   <quote><computeroutput>press the <keycap function="enter">return</keycap>
 *   key</computeroutput></quote>.
 * </para></note>
 * 
 * <note><para>
 *   The <keycap function="delete">delete</keycap> and <keycap
 *   function="backspace">backspace</keycap> keys are merged into a single
 *   keycode because they have such an astonishing history of being confused in
 *   the first place... this spec formally waives any desire to define the
 *   difference. Of course, a library is free to distinguish <keycap
 *   function="delete">delete</keycap> and <keycap
 *   function="backspace">backspace</keycap> during line input. This is when it
 *   matters most; conflating the two during character input should not be a
 *   large problem.
 * </para></note>
 *
 * You can test for this by using the %gestalt_CharInput selector.
 * 
 * <note><para>
 *   Glk porters take note: it is not a goal to be able to generate every
 *   single possible key event. If the library says that it can generate a
 *   particular keycode, then game programmers will assume that it is
 *   available, and ask players to use it. If a <keysym>%keycode_Home</keysym>
 *   event can only be generated by typing <keycombo action="seq"><keycap
 *   function="escape">escape</keycap><keycombo action="simul"><keycap
 *   function="control">control</keycap><keycap>A</keycap></keycombo>
 *   </keycombo>, and the player does not know this, the player will be lost
 *   when the game says <quote><computeroutput>Press the <keycap
 *   function="home">home</keycap> key to see the next 
 *   hint.</computeroutput></quote> It is better for the library to say that it
 *   cannot generate a <keysym>%keycode_Home</keysym> event; that way the game
 *   can detect the situation and ask the user to type <keycap>H</keycap>
 *   instead.
 * </para>
 * <para>
 *   Of course, it is better not to rely on obscure keys in any case. The arrow
 *   keys and <keycap function="enter">return</keycap> are nearly certain to be
 *   available; the others are of gradually decreasing reliability, and you
 *   (the game programmer) should not depend on them. You must be certain to
 *   check for the ones you want to use, including the arrow keys and <keycap
 *   function="enter">return</keycap>, and be prepared to use different keys in
 *   your interface if %gestalt_CharInput says they are not available.

 * 
 * Effectively, any call to glk_put_char() (or the other output commands) which

 * 
 * Note that the echoing is one-way. You can still print text directly to the

 *
 * An echo stream can be of any type, even another window's window stream.
 * 
 * <note><para>
 *   This would be somewhat silly, since it would mean that any text printed to

 * 
 * A window can have mouse input and character/line input pending at the same

 * 
 * <note><para>
 *   Most mouse-based idioms define standard functions for mouse hits in text

 * There are also input streams; these are used for reading from files on disk.
 * It is possible for a stream to be both an input and an output stream.

 * <note><para>
 *   Player input is done through line and character input events, not streams.
 *   This is a small inelegance in theory. In practice, player input is slow and
 *   things can interrupt it, whereas file input is immediate. If a network
 *   extension to Glk were proposed, it would probably use events and not
 *   streams, since network communication is not immediate.
 * </para></note>
 *
 * It is also possible to create a stream that reads or writes to a buffer in
 * memory.
 * 
 * Finally, there may be platform-specific types of streams, which are created
 * before your program starts running. 
 *
 * <note><para>
 *   For example, a program running under Unix may have access to standard input
 *   as a stream, even though there is no Glk call to explicitly open standard
 *   input. On the Mac, data in a Mac resource may be available through a
 *   resource-reading stream.
 * </para></note>
 *
 * You do not need to worry about the origin of such streams; just read or write
 * them as usual. For information about how platform-specific streams come to
 * be, see <link linkend="chimara-Startup-Options">Startup Options</link>.
 * 
 * A stream is opened with a particular file mode, see the 
 * <code>filemode_</code> constants below.
 *
 * <note><para>
 *   In the stdio library, using fopen(), %filemode_Write would be mode
 *   <code>"w"</code>; %filemode_Read would be mode <code>"r"</code>;
 *   %filemode_ReadWrite would be mode <code>"r+"</code>. Confusingly,
 *   %filemode_WriteAppend cannot be mode <code>"a"</code>, because the stdio
 *   spec says that when you open a file with mode <code>"a"</code>, then
 *   fseek() doesn't work. So we have to use mode <code>"r+"</code> for
 *   appending. Then we run into the <emphasis>other</emphasis> stdio problem,
 *   which is that <code>"r+"</code> never creates a new file. So
 *   %filemode_WriteAppend has to <emphasis>first</emphasis> open the file with

 * will fail, in which case the creation function will return %NULL.
 * 
 * Each stream remembers two character counts, the number of characters printed

 * You can send style-changing commands to an output stream. After a style

 * will appear in that style. For a memory stream, style changes have no effect.
 * For a file stream, if the machine supports styled text files, the styles may
 * be written to the file; more likely the style changes will have no effect.
 * 
 * Styles are exclusive. A character is shown with exactly one style, not a 
 * subset of the possible styles.
 *
 * <note><para>
 *  Note that every stream and window has its own idea of the <quote>current 
 *  style.</quote> Sending a style command to one window or stream does not
 *  affect any others.
 * </para></note>
 * <note><para>
 *  Except for a window's echo stream; see <link 
 *  linkend="chimara-Echo-Streams">Echo Streams</link>.
 * </para></note>
 * 
 * The styles are intended to distinguish meaning and use, not formatting. There
 * is no standard definition of what each style will look like. That is left up
 * to the Glk library, which will choose an appearance appropriate for the
 * platform's interface and the player's preferences.
 * 
 * There are currently eleven styles defined. More may be defined in the future.
 * 
 * Styles may be distinguished on screen by font, size, color, indentation,
 * justification, and other attributes. Note that some attributes (notably
 * justification and indentation) apply to entire paragraphs. If possible and
 * relevant, you should apply a style to an entire paragraph &mdash; call 
 * glk_set_style() immediately after printing the newline at the beginning of
 * the text, and do the same at the end.
 * 
 * <note><para>
 *  For example, %style_Header may well be centered text. If you print 
 *  <quote>Welcome to Victim (a short interactive mystery)</quote>, and only the
 *  word <quote>Victim</quote> is in the %style_Header, the center-justification
 *  attribute will be lost. Similarly, a block quote is usually indented on both
 *  sides, but indentation is only meaningful when applied to an entire line or
 *  paragraph, so block quotes should take up an entire paragraph. Contrariwise,
 *  %style_Emphasized need not be used on an entire paragraph. It is often used
 *  for single emphasized words in normal text, so you can expect that it will
 *  appear properly that way; it will be displayed in italics or underlining, 
 *  not center-justified or indented.
 * </para></note>

 * <emphasis>existing</emphasis> windows. They affect the windows which you
 * create subsequently. If you want to set hints for all your game windows, call
 * glk_stylehint_set() before you start creating windows. If you want different
 * hints for different windows, change the hints before creating each window.
 * 
 * <note><para>
 *  This policy makes life easier for the interpreter. It knows everything about
 *  a particular window's appearance when the window is created, and it doesn't
 *  have to change it while the window exists.
 * </para></note>
 * 
 * Hints are hints. The interpreter may ignore them, or give the player a choice
 * about whether to accept them. Also, it is never necessary to set hints. You
 * don't have to suggest that %style_Preformatted be fixed-width, or 
 * %style_Emphasized be boldface or italic; they will have appropriate defaults.
 * Hints are for situations when you want to <emphasis>change</emphasis> the 
 * appearance of a style from what it would ordinarily be. The most common case
 * when this is appropriate is for the styles %style_User1 and %style_User2.
 * 
 * There are currently ten style hints defined. More may be defined in the 
 * future. 
 * 
 * Again, when passing a style hint to a Glk function, any value is actually 
 * legal. If the interpreter does not recognize the stylehint value, it will 
 * ignore it.

/**
 * SECTION:glk-image-resources
 * @short_description: Graphics in Glk
 *
 * In accordance with this modern age, Glk provides for a modicum of graphical
 * flair. It does not attempt to be a complete graphical toolkit. Those already
 * exist. Glk strikes the usual uncomfortable balance between power, 
 * portability, and ease of implementation: commands for arranging pre-supplied
 * images on the screen and intermixed with text.
 * 
 * Graphics is an optional capability in Glk; not all libraries support 
 * graphics. This should not be a surprise.
 * 
 * Most of the graphics commands in Glk deal with image resources. Your program
 * does not have to worry about how images are stored. Everything is a resource,
 * and a resource is referred to by an integer identifier. You may, for example,
 * call a function to display image number 17. The format, loading, and 
 * displaying of that image is entirely up to the Glk library for the platform
 * in question.
 * 
 * Of course, it is also desirable to have a platform-independent way to store
 * sounds and images. Blorb is the official resource-storage format of Glk. A
 * Glk library does not have to understand Blorb, but it is more likely to
 * understand Blorb than any other format.
 *
 * <note><para>
 *   Glk does not specify the exact format of images, but Blorb does. Images in 
 *   a Blorb archive must be PNG or JPEG files. More formats may be added if 
 *   real-world experience shows it to be desirable. However, that is in the 
 *   domain of the Blorb specification. The Glk spec, and Glk programming, will
 *   not change.
 * </para></note>
 * 
 * At present, images can only be drawn in graphics windows and text buffer

 * You should test each with the %gestalt_DrawImage selector if you plan to use
 * it. See <link linkend="chimara-Testing-for-Graphics-Capabilities">Testing for

 * window is resized, you are responsible for redrawing everything. See <link
 * linkend="wintype-Graphics">Graphics Windows</link>.
 * 
 * <note><para>
 *   Note that graphics windows do not support a full set of object-drawing 
 *   commands, nor can you draw text in them. That may be available in a future 
 *   Glk extension. For now, it seems reasonable to limit the task to a single 
 *   primitive, the drawing of a raster image. And then there's the ability to
 *   fill a rectangle with a solid color &mdash; a small extension, and 
 *   hopefully no additional work for the library, since it can already clear 
 *   with arbitrary background colors. In fact, if glk_window_fill_rect() did 
 *   not exist, an author could invent it &mdash; by briefly setting the
 *   background color, erasing a rectangle, and restoring.

 * 
 * If you call glk_image_draw() or glk_image_draw_scaled() in a graphics window,
 * @val1 and @val2 are interpreted as X and Y coordinates. The image will be 
 * drawn with its upper left corner at this position.
 * 
 * It is legitimate for part of the image to fall outside the window; the excess
 * is not drawn. Note that these are signed arguments, so you can draw an image
 * which falls outside the left or top edge of the window, as well as the right
 * or bottom.

/**
 * SECTION:glk-graphics-text
 * @short_description: Drawing graphics inside or beside text
 *
 * A text buffer is a linear text stream. You can draw images in-line with this
 * text. If you are familiar with HTML, you already understand this model. You
 * draw images with flags indicating alignment. The library takes care of
 * scrolling, resizing, and reformatting text buffer windows.
 *
 * If you call glk_image_draw() or glk_image_draw_scaled() in a text buffer
 * window, @val1 gives the image alignment. The @val2 argument is currently
 * unused, and should always be zero.
 *
 * The two <quote>margin</quote> alignments require some care. To allow proper 
 * positioning, images using %imagealign_MarginLeft and %imagealign_MarginRight 
 * must be placed at the beginning of a line. That is, you may only call 
 * glk_image_draw() (with these two alignments) in a window, if you have just 
 * printed a newline to the window's stream, or if the window is entirely empty.
 * If you margin-align an image in a line where text has already appeared, no 
 * image will appear at all.
 * 
 * Inline-aligned images count as <quote>text</quote> for the purpose of this

/**
 * wintype_TextBuffer: 
 *
 * A text buffer window contains a linear stream of text. It supports output;
 * when you print to it, the new text is added to the end. There is no way for
 * you to affect text which has already been printed. There are no guarantees
 * about how much text the window keeps; old text may be stored forever, so
 * that the user can scroll back to it, or it may be thrown away as soon as it
 * scrolls out of the window. 
 * 
 * <note><para>
 *   Therefore, there may or may not be a player-controllable scroll bar or
 *   other scrolling widget.
 * </para></note>
 * 
 * The display of the text in a text buffer is up to the library. Lines will
 * probably not be broken in the middles of words &mdash; but if they are, the
 * library is not doing anything illegal, only ugly. Text selection and copying
 * to a clipboard, if available, are handled however is best on the player's
 * machine. Paragraphs (as defined by newline characters in the output) may be
 * indented. 
 * 
 * <note><para>
 *   You should not, in general, fake this by printing spaces before each
 *   paragraph of prose text. Let the library and player preferences handle
 *   that. Special cases (like indented lists) are of course up to you.
 * </para></note>
 * 
 * When a text buffer is cleared (with glk_window_clear()), the library will do
 * something appropriate; the details may vary. It may clear the window, with
 * later text appearing at the top &mdash; or the bottom. It may simply print
 * enough blank lines to scroll the current text out of the window. It may
 * display a distinctive page-break symbol or divider.
 * 
 * The size of a text buffer window is necessarily imprecise. Calling
 * glk_window_get_size() will return the number of rows and columns that would
 * be available <emphasis>if</emphasis> the window was filled with 
 * <quote>0</quote> (zero) characters in the <quote>normal</quote> font.
 * However, the window may use a non-fixed-width font, so that number of
 * characters in a line could vary. The window might even support 
 * variable-height text (say, if the player is using large text for emphasis);
 * that would make the number of lines in the window vary as well.
 * 
 * Similarly, when you set a fixed-size split in the measurement system of a
 * text buffer, you are setting a window which can handle a fixed number of rows
 * (or columns) of <quote>0</quote> characters. The number of rows (or
 * characters) that will actually be displayed depends on font variances.
 * 
 * A text buffer window supports both character and line input, but not mouse
 * input.
 * 
 * In character input, there will be some visible signal that the window is
 * waiting for a keystroke. (Typically, a cursor at the end of the text.) When
 * the player hits a key in that window, an event is generated, but the key is
 * <emphasis>not</emphasis> printed in the window.
 * 
 * In line input, again, there will be some visible signal. It is most common
 * for the player to compose input in the window itself, at the end of the text.
 * (This is how IF story input usually looks.) But it's not strictly required.
 * An alternative approach is the way MUD clients usually work: there is a
 * dedicated one-line input window, outside of Glk's window space, and the user
 * composes input there.
 * 
 * <note><para>
 *   If this approach is used, there will still be some way to handle input from
 *   two windows at once. It is the library's responsibility to make this
 *   available to the player. You only need request line input and  wait for the
 *   result.
 * </para></note>
 * 
 * By default, when the player finishes his line of input, the library will
 * display the input text at the end of the buffer text (if it wasn't there
 * already.) It will be followed by a newline, so that the next text you print
 * will start a new line (paragraph) after the input.
 * 
 * If you call glk_cancel_line_event(), the same thing happens; whatever text
 * the user was composing is visible at the end of the buffer text, followed by
 * a newline.
 *
 * However, this default behavior can be changed with the
 * glk_set_echo_line_event() call. If the default echoing is disabled, the
 * library will <emphasis>not</emphasis> display the input text (plus newline)
 * after input is either completed or cancelled. The buffer will end with
 * whatever prompt you displayed before requesting input. If you want the
 * traditional input behavior, it is then your responsibility to print the text,
 * using the Input text style, followed by a newline (in the original style).

/**
 * wintype_TextGrid: 
 * 
 * A text grid contains a rectangular array of characters, in a fixed-width
 * font. Its size is the number of columns and rows of the array.
 * 
 * A text grid window supports output. It maintains knowledge of an output
 * cursor position. When the window is opened, it is filled with blanks (space
 * characters), and the output cursor starts in the top left corner &mdash;
 * character (0,0). If the window is cleared with glk_window_clear(), the window
 * is filled with blanks again, and the cursor returns to the top left corner.
 * 
 * When you print, the characters of the output are laid into the array in
 * order, left to right and top to bottom. When the cursor reaches the end of a
 * line, or if a newline (0x0A) is printed, the cursor goes to the beginning of
 * the next line. The library makes <emphasis>no</emphasis> attempt to wrap
 * lines at word breaks. If the cursor reaches the end of the last line, further
 * printing has no effect on the window until the cursor is moved.
 * 
 * <note><para>
 *   Note that printing fancy characters may cause the cursor to advance more
 *   than one position per character. (For example, the <quote>&aelig;</quote>
 *   ligature may print as two characters.) See <link 
 *   linkend="chimara-Output">Output</link>, for how to test this situation.
 * </para></note>
 * 
 * You can set the cursor position with glk_window_move_cursor().
 * 
 * When a text grid window is resized smaller, the bottom or right area is
 * thrown away, but the remaining area stays unchanged. When it is resized
 * larger, the new bottom or right area is filled with blanks.
 * 
 * <note><para>
 *   You may wish to watch for %evtype_Arrange events, and clear-and-redraw your
 *   text grid windows when you see them change size.
 * </para></note>
 * 
 * Text grid window support character and line input, as well as mouse input (if
 * a mouse is available.)
 * 
 * Mouse input returns the position of the character that was touched, from
 * (0,0) to 
 * <inlineequation>
 *   <alt>(width-1,height-1)</alt>
 *   <mathphrase>(width - 1, height - 1)</mathphrase>
 * </inlineequation>
 * .
 * 
 * Character input is as described in the previous section.
 * 
 * Line input is slightly different; it is guaranteed to take place in the
 * window, at the output cursor position. The player can compose input only to
 * the right edge of the window; therefore, the maximum input length is
 * <inlineequation>
 *   <alt>(windowwidth - 1 - cursorposition)</alt>
 *   <mathphrase>(windowwidth - 1 - cursorposition)</mathphrase>
 * </inlineequation>
 * . If the maxlen argument of glk_request_line_event() is smaller than this,
 * the library will not allow the input cursor to go more than maxlen characters
 * past its start point. 
 * 
 * <note><para>
 *   This allows you to enter text in a fixed-width field, without the player
 *   being able to overwrite other parts of the window.
 * </para></note>
 * 
 * When the player finishes his line of input, it will remain visible in the
 * window, and the output cursor will be positioned at the beginning of the

 *   You may wish to watch for %evtype_Arrange events, and clear-and-redraw your
 *   graphics windows when you see them change size.
 * </para></note>
 * 
 * In some libraries, you can receive a graphics-redraw event (%evtype_Redraw)
 * at any time. This signifies that the window in question has been cleared to

 * windows, you <emphasis>must</emphasis> handle these events.
 * 
 * <note><para>
 *   Redraw events can be triggered when a Glk window is uncovered or made
 *   visible by the platform's window manager. On the other hand, some Glk

 *   &mdash; perhaps the screen's color depth has changed. So redraw events are
 *   always a possibility, even in clever libraries. This is why you must be
 *   prepared to handle them.
 * 
 *   However, you will not receive a redraw event when you create a graphics
 *   window. It is assumed that you will do the initial drawing of your own
 *   accord. You also do not get redraw events when a graphics window is
 *   enlarged. If you ordered the enlargement, you already know about it; if the
 *   player is responsible, you receive a window-arrangement event, which covers
 *   the situation.

/**
 * gidispatch_call:

 *
 * @funcnum is the function number to invoke; see <link 
 * linkend="chimara-Table-of-Selectors">Table of Selectors</link>. @arglist is
 * the list of arguments, and @numargs is the length of the list.
 * 
 * The arguments are all stored as #gluniversal_t objects. 
 * </para><refsect3 id="chimara-Basic-Dispatch-Types"><title>Basic Dispatch

 * Numeric arguments are passed in the obvious way &mdash; one argument per
 * #gluniversal_t, with the @uint or @sint field set to the numeric value.
 * Characters and strings are also passed in this way &mdash; #char<!---->s in
 * the @uch, @sch, or @ch fields (depending on whether the #char is signed) and
 * strings in the @charstr field. Opaque objects (windows, streams, etc) are
 * passed in the @opaqueref field (which is <code>void*</code>, in order to
 * handle all opaque pointer types.)
 * 
 * However, pointers (other than C strings), arrays, and structures complicate
 * life. So do return values.
 * </para></refsect3>
 * <refsect3 id="chimara-References"><title>References</title><para>
 * A reference to a numeric type or object reference &mdash; that is,
 * <code>#glui32*</code>, <code>#winid_t*</code>, and so on &mdash; takes
 * <emphasis>one or two</emphasis> #gluniversal_t objects. The first is a flag
 * indicating whether the reference argument is %NULL or not. The @ptrflag field
 * of this #gluniversal_t should be %FALSE (0) if the reference is %NULL, and
 * %TRUE (1) otherwise. If %FALSE, that is the end of the argument; you should
 * not use a #gluniversal_t to explicitly store the %NULL reference. If the flag
 * is %TRUE, you must then put a #gluniversal_t storing the base type of the
 * reference.
 *
 * For example, consider a hypothetical function, with selector 
 * <code>0xABCD</code>:
 * |[ 
 * void glk_glomp(glui32 num, winid_t win, glui32 *numref, strid_t *strref);
 * ]|
 * ...and the calls:
 * |[
 * glui32 value;
 * winid_t mainwin;
 * strid_t gamefile;
 * glk_glomp(5, mainwin, &value, &gamefile);
 * ]|
 *
 * To perform this through gidispatch_call(), you would do the following:
 * |[
 * gluniversal_t arglist[6];
 * arglist[0].uint = 5;
 * arglist[1].opaqueref = mainwin;
 * arglist[2].ptrflag = TRUE;
 * arglist[3].uint = value;
 * arglist[4].ptrflag = TRUE;
 * arglist[5].opaqueref = gamefile;
 * gidispatch_call(0xABCD, 6, arglist);
 * value = arglist[3].uint;
 * gamefile = arglist[5].opaqueref;
 * ]|
 * 
 * Note that you copy the value of the reference arguments into and out of
 * @arglist. Of course, it may be that 
 * <function>glk_glomp&lpar;&rpar;</function> only uses these as pass-out
 * references or pass-in references; if so, you could skip copying in or out.
 *
 * For further examples:
 * |[
 * glk_glomp(7, mainwin, NULL, NULL);
 * ...or...
 * gluniversal_t arglist[4];
 * arglist[0].uint = 7;
 * arglist[1].opaqueref = mainwin;
 * arglist[2].ptrflag = FALSE;
 * arglist[3].ptrflag = FALSE;
 * gidispatch_call(0xABCD, 4, arglist);
 * ]|
 *
 * |[
 * glk_glomp(13, NULL, NULL, &gamefile);
 * ...or...
 * gluniversal_t arglist[5];
 * arglist[0].uint = 13;
 * arglist[1].opaqueref = NULL;
 * arglist[2].ptrflag = FALSE;
 * arglist[3].ptrflag = TRUE;
 * arglist[4].opaqueref = gamefile;
 * gidispatch_call(0xABCD, 5, arglist);
 * gamefile = arglist[4].opaqueref;
 * ]|
 *
 * |[
 * glk_glomp(17, NULL, &value, NULL);
 * ...or...
 * gluniversal_t arglist[5];
 * arglist[0].uint = 17;
 * arglist[1].opaqueref = NULL;
 * arglist[2].ptrflag = TRUE;
 * arglist[3].uint = value;
 * arglist[4].ptrflag = FALSE;
 * gidispatch_call(0xABCD, 5, arglist);
 * value = arglist[3].uint;
 * ]|
 * 
 * As you see, the length of @arglist depends on how many of the reference
 * arguments are %NULL.
 * </para></refsect3>
 * <refsect3 id="chimara-Structures"><title>Structures</title><para>
 * A structure pointer is represented by a single @ptrflag, possibly followed by
 * a sequence of #gluniversal_t objects (one for each field of the structure.)
 * Again, if the structure pointer is non-%NULL, the @ptrflag should be %TRUE
 * and be followed by values; if not, the @ptrflag should be %NULL and stands
 * alone.
 * 
 * For example, the function glk_select() can be invoked as follows:
 * |[
 * event_t ev;
 * gluniversal_t arglist[5];
 * arglist[0].ptrflag = TRUE;
 * gidispatch_call(0x00C0, 5, arglist);
 * ev.type = arglist[1].uint;
 * ev.win = arglist[2].opaqueref;
 * ev.val1 = arglist[3].uint;
 * ev.val2 = arglist[4].uint;
 * ]|
 * 
 * Since the structure passed to glk_select() is a pass-out reference (the entry
 * values are ignored), you don't need to fill in <code>arglist[1..4]</code>
 * before calling gidispatch_call().
 * 
 * <note><para>
 *   Theoretically, you would invoke <code>#glk_select(%NULL)</code> by setting'
 *   <code>arglist[0].ptrflag</code> to %FALSE, and using a one-element @arglist
 *   instead of five-element. But it's illegal to pass %NULL to glk_select(). So
 *   you cannot actually do this.
 * </para></note></para></refsect3>
 * <refsect3 id="chimara-Arrays"><title>Arrays</title><para>
 * In the Glk API, an array argument is always followed by a numeric argument
 * giving the array's length. These two C arguments are a single logical
 * argument, which is represented by <emphasis>one or three</emphasis>
 * #gluniversal_t objects. The first is a @ptrflag, indicating whether the
 * argument is %NULL or not. The second is a pointer, stored in the @array
 * field. The third is the array length, stored in the @uint field. And again,
 * if the @ptrflag is %NULL, the following two are omitted.
 * 
 * For example, the function glk_put_buffer() can be invoked as follows:
 * |[
 * char buf[64];
 * glui32 len = 64;
 * glk_put_buffer(buf, len);
 * ...or...
 * gluniversal_t arglist[3];
 * arglist[0].ptrflag = TRUE;
 * arglist[1].array = buf;
 * arglist[2].uint = len;
 * gidispatch_call(0x0084, 3, arglist);
 * ]|
 * 
 * Since you are passing a C char array to gidispatch_call(), the contents will
 * be read directly from that. There is no need to copy data into @arglist, as
 * you would for a basic type.
 * 
 * If you are implementing a VM whose native representation of char arrays is
 * more complex, you will have to do more work. You should allocate a C char
 * array, copy your characters into it, make the call, and then free the array.
 *
 * <note><para>
 *   glk_put_buffer() does not modify the array passed to it, so there is no
 *   need to copy the characters out.
 * </para></note></para></refsect3>
 * <refsect3 id="chimara-Return-Values"><title>Return Values</title><para>
 * The return value of a function is not treated specially. It is simply
 * considered to be a pass-out reference argument which may not be %NULL. It
 * comes after all the other arguments of the function.
 * 
 * For example, the function glk_window_get_rock() can be invoked as follows:
 * |[
 * glui32 rock;
 * winid_t win;
 * rock = glk_window_get_rock(win);
 * ...or...
 * gluniversal_t arglist[3];
 * arglist[0].opaqueref = win;

 *
 * Loads a chunk of a given type. The @count parameter distinguishes between

 * loaded, and so on.
 * 
 * To load a chunk of an IFF FORM type (such as AIFF), you should pass in the 
 * form type, rather than FORM.
 * <note><para>
 *  This introduces a slight ambiguity &mdash; you cannot distiguish between a 
 *  FORM AIFF chunk and a non-FORM chunk of type AIFF. However, the latter is 
 *  almost certainly a mistake.
 * </para></note> 
 * 
 * The returned data is written into @res, according to @method.
 * 
 * The <structfield>chunknum</structfield> field is filled in with the number of
 * the chunk. (This value can then be passed to giblorb_load_chunk_by_number() 
 * or giblorb_unload_chunk().) The <structfield>length</structfield> field is 
 * filled in with the length of the chunk in bytes. The 
 * <structfield>chunktype</structfield> field is the chunk's type, which of 
 * course will be the type you asked for.

 * If you specify %giblorb_method_DontLoad, no data is actually loaded in. You
 * can use this if you are only interested in whether a chunk exists, or in the
 * <structfield>chunknum</structfield> and <structfield>length</structfield> 
 * parameters.
 * 
 * If you specify %giblorb_method_FilePos, 
 * <structfield>data.startpos</structfield> is filled in with the file position
 * of the chunk data. You can use glk_stream_set_position() to read the data 
 * from the stream.
 * 
 * If you specify %giblorb_method_Memory, <structfield>data.ptr</structfield> is
 * filled with a pointer to allocated memory containing the chunk data. This 
 * memory is owned by the map, not you. If you load the chunk more than once 
 * with %giblorb_method_Memory, the Blorb layer is smart enough to keep just one
 * copy in memory. You should not deallocate this memory yourself; call 
 * giblorb_unload_chunk() instead.
