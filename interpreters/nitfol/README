This is release 0.5 of Nitfol, a z-machine interpreter using Glk for
its input and output.  This release should be considered beta quality.

Nitfol was written from scratch, with portability in mind.  There's
probably some stuff in there that isn't portable, so if you find some,
let me know.  It supports z1 through z8.  z6 sort of works, but
doesn't display everything correctly.

Play.  Let me know if you can crash it or get it to do things an
interpreter shouldn't.

See INSTALL for compilation/installation instructions.

See nitfol.html or nitfol.info for full documentation.
